// Practice Drill 2: Accessors and Mutators in a Fruit Class
// Create a class Fruit with private member variables ripeness of type int and type of type string.
// Accessors and Mutators:

// Write accessor and mutator methods for both ripeness and type. In the mutator for ripeness, include validation to ensure ripeness is within a reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 10).
// Formatting Specification for displayInfo:

// Display the fruit type and ripeness level on the same line.
// Ripeness level should be displayed as "Ripeness Level: X/10", where X is the ripeness value.
// Practice Drill 3: Applying Const to Member Functions in a Planet Class
// Define a class Planet with a private member variable diameter of type double.
// Implement a Const Member Function:

// Write a public member function getVolume() that calculates and returns the volume of the planet. Mark this function as const since it does not modify the object.
// Formatting Specification for displayVolume:

// Format the volume output to two decimal places.
// Display the volume with the label "Planet Volume:" followed by the calculated volume and the unit "cubic units".
// Practice Drill 4: Utilizing Private and Public Sections in an Artifact Class
// Create a class Artifact with private member variables era (string) and origin (string), and a public method displayInfo() that prints the era and origin.
// Initialization:

// Include a constructor in Artifact that takes era and origin as parameters and initializes the respective member variables.
// Formatting Specification for displayInfo:

// Format the era output, ensuring it is left-aligned and occupies a width of 20 characters.
// Display the era and origin on the same line, with "Artifact Era:" as the label for era and "Origin:" as the label for origin.
